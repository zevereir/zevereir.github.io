# Simple instructions


## Getting started

For more about how to use Jekyll, check out [this tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/).



### Installation

Assuming you have [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) (Ruby+Devkit on Windows) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed on your system, first fork the theme to `github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>` and do the following:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git
$ cd <your-repo-name>
$ bundle install
```

### Configuration



1. Launch the site by running this command, which will host the website on [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/). Run this command after every ```_config.yml``` update.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

2. Go to ```_config.yml``` and update the properties:
- Your first name in ```first_name```
- Your last name in ```last_name```
- Your personnel number in ```ku_leuven_personnel_number``` to link up your publications (number AFTER the u)
- Your social media profiles that you would like to link 
- `show_news` to `false` if you don't want to post news message on your website.


3. Go to ```_pages/about.md``` and fill in your own biography to display.

4. Update ```assets/img/prof_pic.jpg``` to a picture of yourself (file name updatable in ```_pages/about.md```)

5. Add your teaching activities (teaching assistant, thesis students, seminars) to the csv files in ```_data/teaching/```.

6. Create your projects by copying and editing the content of the ```_projects folder```

7. If you prefer a different theme color, go to ```_sass/_variables.scss``` and change ```$theme-color: $blue;``` to any color defined above this line.

#### Publications with Jekyll-Scholar
There are two options for your publications: 1) just show the Lirias automatically generated page, or 2) you can get more control over your publication page by using the Jekyll-Scholar plugin. To use Lirias, just fill in your personnel number in the _config.yml file (as described above). To use Jekyll-Scholar, keep reading this section.

Advantages of Jekyll-Scholar:
- Use bibtex files to import your publications 
- Get control over which publications you show and how you group and order them
- Ability to add extra fields to your bibtex entries to include links to paper arxiv page, pdfs, supplementary materials, code, slides, poster, videos, and anything else if you want to.
- Cite your and other's work anywhere in your website, simply using {% cite <bibtex-key> %}  

1. Go to ```_config.yml``` and update the properties:
- Set ```use_scholar``` to ```true```
- Your last name in ```scholar: last_name```

2. Add your bibtex file to ```_bibliography/references.bib```.  Now you already have a basic publications page. But keep reading to make it less basic :-)


3. Add links to your publications
    
    1. If you add an ```abstract``` to your bibtex entry, a button ```[Abstract]``` will appear that shows your abstract below when you click on it.

    2. Link to arXiv by setting the ```arxiv``` field to the arXiv ID of your paper.
   
    3. Add a video (e.g. talk recording) setting the ```video``` field to the url of the video.
  
    4. You can add attachments to your bibtex entries by storing them in ``assets/pdf/``` and linking to them in your bibtex entry. The possible attachments are ```pdf```,```supp```,```slides```,```poster```. Link to them by adding the filenames to the corresponding bibtex field.


4. Fill out the information about your co-authors in ```_data/coauthors.yml```. This will make the names of your co-authors in your publication list link to their personal websites.

5. See the [Jekyll-Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/) documentation for learning how to sort, group and filter your publications, how to cite papers, and how to use multiple bib files (e.g. to add an extra bib file with other papers that you like to cite).





### Deployment

After you are done, **commit** your final changes.
Now, you can deploy your website to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) by running the deploy script:

```bash
$ ./bin/deploy [--user]
```
By default, the script uses the `master` branch for the source code and deploys the webpage to `gh-pages`.
The optional flag `--user` tells it to deploy to `master` and use `source` for the source code instead.
Using `master` for deployment is a convention for [user and organization pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).
